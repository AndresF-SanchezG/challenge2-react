# Build a Markdown Previewer

This JavaScript code demonstrates a basic web application developed using the React library. The application is comprised of two primary sections: an editing area (text editor) and a preview area. Its primary function is to allow users to input text with Markdown-style formatting in the editor. The code includes a class named MyForm that extends React.Component, signifying its role as a React component. Within the constructor, the component's initial state is established, containing a field called "textarea" holding a sample Markdown text. The handleChange function is associated with the component, enabling it to update the textarea state when the editing textarea content changes. The render method returns the user interface's layout, featuring an editing section with a textarea that reflects the textarea state's content, and a preview section exhibiting the rendered content of the textarea state. The marked function converts Markdown to HTML and is rendered through dangerouslySetInnerHTML within the div element.
